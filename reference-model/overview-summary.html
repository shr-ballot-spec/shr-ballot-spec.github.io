In CIMI V0.0.4, this class was called Assertion, but CIMI recently decided to change the name to AssertionTopic, as anticipated here. In CIMI V0.0.4, Assertion defines three attributes: dateAsserted, verificationStatus, and findingMethod. VerificationStatus properly only applies in the PresenceContext context, and can be found there. FindingMethod more properly belongs in FindingTopic, and can be found there.</div>

The following steps are required to create this class in CIMI:

1) Update the CIMI Reference Model, adding the property MorphologyBehavior to create BreastCancerConditionTopic class.
2) Create an archetype of ClinicalStatement that combines the new topic BreastCancerConditionTopic with the ConditionPresenceContext, and introduces constraints on Value, Category, Stage, and MorphologyBehavior.

In this model, the path of least work was to subclass Condition, add the new attribute, and introduce the required constraints, all at once.

The attributes of ClinicalStatement are not included in this class because of the mapping difficulties discussed in Entry.</div>

A clinical statement is composed of the StatementTopic class (grouping of attributes for capturing information about a procedure or a clinical finding) and the StatementContext class (grouping of attributes providing the context for the statement topic such as whether a procedure was performed, requested, not performed or whether a finding is suspected present or absent in the patient). At the archetype level, the topic and context components are coordinated to form the clinical statement. For instance, the composition of the ProcedureTopic with the NotPerformed context indicates that the given procedure was not performed.</div>

		NOTE: In CIMI Version 0.0.4, processing of a specimen is represented as an independent clinical statement involving a SpecimenProcessingTopic and PerformanceContext. The CIMI clinical statement would be mapped to FHIR as a Procedure. In this case, the procedure involves chilling the specimen (the key or code) and the duration of that procedure (corresponding to PerformanceContext.duration) would be interpreted as the cold ischemic time. The drawback of this would be that the information on cold ischemic time (necessary for interpreting results) would not travel with the specimen. To provide a cutpoint between this IG and the rest of CIMI, and to avoid unnecessary complexity, an extension was introduced.</div>

		Specimen collection time seems to be missing in CIMI V0.0.4. Given that is not in Specimen, the next place to look is in the associated CollectionProcedure, specifically in the Performance context of the clinical statement representing that procedure. But there is no time found there, either, only a temporalContext (type Concept) and duration (not a point in time). If the specimen collection time is supposed to be recorded in Performance.Attribution (a list of actions), it would be nearly impossible to create a mapping.</div>

In CIMI terms, it is an archetype of ClinicalStatement that combines a ConditionTopic with the ConditionPresenceContext context. The core attributes of ClinicalStatement are not included here because of mapping difficulties to FHIR DomainResource.

In CIMI V0.0.4, this class would be represented as an archetype, specifically, a ClinicalStatement whose topic is ConditionAssertion and whose context is AssertionKnownOrSuspectedPresent. The name of the CIMI archetype has not been determined as of V0.0.4;. Here, the class is called Condition because it corresponds to FHIR Condition.</div>

In CIMI Version 0.0.4, this class was called AssertionKnownOrSuspectedPresent. The corresponding CIMI class is ungoing a name change to include the word &#39;StatementContext&#39; and remove the word &#39;Assertion&#39;.

The presence of terminology bindings (necessary to align with FHIR clinicalStatus, severity, and criticality) means that this class cannot be defined entirely within the CIMI reference model. The constraints could only exist in an archetype derived from the reference model class. The logical model here represents both the class structure and the terminology bindings.</div>

In CIMI Version 0.0.4, the corresponding reference model class was called ConditionAssertion. The CIMI name is being changed to ConditionTopic (perhaps ConditionAssertionTopic), as anticipated here. In CIMI Version 0.0.4, the ConditionAssertion has properties associated with the presence of the condition, including severity, dueTo, diseasePhase, and more. In the current logical model, the properties associated with the occurrence of a condition have been placed (more appropriately) with ConditionPresenceContext.

The presence of terminology bindings (necessary to align with FHIR Condition.category and enforce the extensible binding in US Core of Condition.code) means that this class cannot be defined entirely within the CIMI reference model. The constraints could only exist in an archetype derived from the reference model class. The logical model here represents both the class structure and the terminology bindings.</div>

In CIMI V0.0.4, Entities were not stand-alone classes. However, this is currently being changed in CIMI, so in the future, CIMI entities will more closely correspond to the FHIR entity-like resources such as Organization, Location, Device, Substance, and the like. In order to map to FHIR and produce profiles for this ballot, this change has been anticipated.

Further, in CIMI V0.0.4, Entity was a subclass of Party. Party is part of CIMI&#39;s participation model that is currently undergoing review and revision. Rather than introducing the complexity the CIMI participation model, which has little relevance to the current ballot of cancer profiles and is undergoing revision anyway, the superclass Party has been omitted.</div>

          <div class="block">The base class, independent of context for evaluations (measurements, tests, or questions) and a value containing the result (answer). 

The subject of a finding can be the entire patient, or an entity such as a location body structure, intervention, or condition. Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments.

In CIMI Version 0.0.4, LaboratoryTestResult.specimen is 0..* but that cardinality makes it impossible to map to FHIR Observation, because Observation.specimen is 0..1. Therefore, the cardinality of Specimen is changed to 0..1 to be consistent with FHIR.

In CIMI Version 0.0.4, Findings (including EvaluationResult and LaboratoryTestResult) do not have related (&#39;has-member&#39;) observations, nor components (sub-observations). These features of FHIR Observations were found to be very useful in modeling breast cancer pathology, and so they are included here. This represents a significant departure from the CIMI model.</div>

(2) Status might not have the same interpretation in all child classes.
